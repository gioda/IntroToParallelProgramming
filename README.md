# IntroToParallelProgramming

***Note***
All the material in this repository is taken (and maybe modify) from a Udacity online curse ["Intro to Parallel Programming"](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344). [YouTube](https://youtu.be/F620ommtjqk). 

As written in the webpage:
> Learn the fundamentals of parallel computing with the **GPU** and the **CUDA** programming environment! In this class, you'll learn about parallel programming by coding a series of image processing algorithms, such as you might find in Photoshop or Instagram. You'll be able to program and run your assignments on high-end GPUs, even if you don't own one yourself.
